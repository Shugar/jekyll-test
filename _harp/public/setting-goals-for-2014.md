<b>12 New Projects</b><br>
ABS and JFS. I want to ship 12 new projects this year. Distractions suck, and taking on more projects is counter intuitive. They keep things interesting, stem new ideas, new learnings, and creativity. I want to start and ship 12 new projects outside of regular business. This could include launching a new website/product, learning a new skill, or hobby. One new project, every month... taking no more than a weekend to build/learn.


<b>24 Blog Posts</b><br>
Write a minimum of 2 new blog posts per month covering trends, predictions, findings, client work, major wins, and epic fails.

Improve eating, sleeping, and mental habits. Add regular meditation to daily routine. More gym!
