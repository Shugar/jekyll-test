Epic wins/fails of fundraising 10k and relaunching a NFP website in 5 weeks



Intro
-

Homelessness is a serious issue. It exists worldwide with each region facing their own unique problems and challenges to overcome. 

Vancouver is no exception. It's something I see on a daily basis and have no solution for. 

3 years ago, my girlfriend Tawny returned home from work with news of a website that allowed people to read stories and donate gifts to homeless people in our neighborhood. 

> "It's like Secret Santa, but for people that really need help'"

That website was called Homeless Partners. It's a program that I recently helped raise 10k and rebuild their website. This post will cover some candid thoughts on the program, and some steps (both good/bad) I took towards a successful indiegogo campaign and new website.

That first year, Tawny and I donated a shaving kit, shampoo, and bus passes for 2 people at the Living Room drop in center located in the Downtown East Side. The following year, Tawny organized a facebook group for 20 of our friends to crowdsource 15 gifts. During that time, we noticed the website was having a few problems and decided to reach out to the founders to ask if they needed a hand. 

After a few conversations, I promsised Jennie (founder) I would work with other people in the Vancouver startup community to deliver a new website for the following year/Christmas. 


From our first conversation, Homeless Partners:
<ul>
<li> founded in 2005</li>
<li>everything to date powered by volunteers</li>
<li>never recieved funding/donations</li>
<li>no charity or nfp status </li>
<li>unknown number of signups/pledges (no stats)</li>
<li>programs across 11 cities in north america</li>
<li>media coverage across canada (cbc, national, globe and mail, global tv, radio, etc)</li>
<li>based out Victoria</li>
<li>no budget or volunteers to help rebuild website</li>
<li>sensitive and contreversial subject </li>
</ul>

<br>
From that conversation I wanted to repalce the old website with a new lander to capture emails and try to attract new volunteers. I thought the best way to proceed would to become a registered charity. That makes things more official and allows HP to issue tax reciepts for donations and attract more volunteers. Everything to date had been powered by volunteers and the founders had funded the project from their account. That doesn't work for scaling thing, so I pitched the idea of an indiegogo/kickstarter campaign. 

If we could raise 10k, we could:
<ul>
<li>become a registered charity</li>
<li>hire a p/t person</li>
<li>purchase marketing tools/web hosting</li>
<li>grow the program to more cities</li>
</ul>



During the summer months we launched a new landing page for the new website and  reached out to potential volunteers to help rebuild the website for the upcoming year.

Part of the new lander was to help communicate what Homeless Partners is, and what their mission statement is.

> "We're a Not-For-Profit organization on a mission to help homeless people around the world. Our platform allows communities to launch local Christmas wish lists"


The new landing page went up in August a few weeks before I announced <a href="http://kenny.is/launching-viral-foundry">my next project</a>.
