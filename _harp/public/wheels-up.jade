  |User Generated Content = Gold

p.post-text
  |Continue to see more brands and businesses leveraging social media to advertise and showcase products (integrate consumer generated photos and videos into your ecommerce and review pages).

  |Mobile Shopping Tools/Apps

p.post-text
  |Big chains will offer companion tools for on/offline shopping. This already happens today, but better tools for customers and business 
  |owners. Walk down the aisle with companion apps that can price check, read reviews, manage your shopping list and ask for help. Who’s going |to make the best companion app where groups/family can collaborate on shopping lists?



h2.post-title
  |Exclusive Product Lines

p.post-text
  |Huge push for exclusive product lines. Big box outlets forced to spend big dollars experimenting and creating new product lines. New |entrepreneurial hubs to incubate new product lines sponsored by big box chains. Great time for makers. Outlets are willing to experiment and |take on more risk.

  |Interactive Shops & Shopping Experiences

p.post-text
  |As shopping malls close, businesses work together to deliver new shopping experiences. In other words, new ways to attract customers and keep 
  |them in store/ on premise for as long as possible. Focus on building environments where people want to be seen and heard. That could be |expensive decor (think Vegas casinos), live performers, cool hangout areas, live product keynotes for brands, and fashion shows. 

  |These experiences are extended to online interactive showrooms that customers access via desktops, tablets, mobile devices, or gaming |consoles. Each platform offers new ways for consumers to discover and interact with products. This could be as simple as google hangouts with 
  |your favorite shop, or choose your own shopping adventure (stores offering different layouts, themes to shop from, or even virtual shops).

  |Personalized Shopping Assistants

p.post-text
  |Big data with online shopping behaviour, in-store behaviour, and past purchase history leads to some interesting opportunities for marketers, 
  |both on and offline. This new marketing method should be used for world class customer support, unfortunately this super power will be |abused; iBeacons will pave the way.




h2.post-title
  |Social Proof / Couponing

p.post-text
  |Expect to walk down the aisle, or browse products with local and relevant messaging as it relates to you, your network, and your community. |More focus on social networks, reviews, referrals, community, and how people you know and trust make purchases. Coupons and unique offers |sent strategically. 


blockquote
  |“Get $5.00 rebate if you provide video review within 30 days of using product.”
