<p> Last Thursday (August 4, 2015) I booked a one way ticket to Split, Croatia. These keystrokes come to you from 36k feet above the friendly skies of Austria. </p>

<p>  Over the last 20 hours (YVR-SFO-FRA-SPU) I've had time to reflect on the goals of my trip, implications and business opportunities involved with running a remote business. Today, I want to publicly share some personal thoughts on why I decided to pack everything and fly to Europe. In addition, I'll openly discuss some experiments, challenges I foresee, and areas I want to work on.</p>

 
<b>Family, friends, clients, and advisors have asked repeatedly: why Croatia? When are you coming back? Are you shutting down Promo? What about your investors? What about your clients? Are you okay? This feels awfully rushed</b><br>

<p>  No, I'm not having a meltdown. I'm still committed to building products that fix real life problems. We'll continue to explore ways promo helps business with promotion management and distribution. As long as we can deliver, then why does it matter where we work from?</p> 

<br>
<b>Do you have an agenda?</b><br>

<p>  No. I plan to chase the sun, work 50 hours per week, and keep monthly burn down. I hope to visit/live in the following countries : Croatia, Greece, Spain, Italy, Germany, France, USA (NY/SF), </p>

<h2>Experiment 1 / hypothesis</h2>
<p>  Building a startup with remote team </p>
<br><br>
<p>  Will I enjoy working abroad? Living out of a suitcase and constantly looking for fast internet? </p><br>
<p>  Can the team work together remotely? </p> <br>
<p>  Can we find product market fit for Promo?</p> <br>
 
<br><br>

<p>  Over the last few years, we've seen an influx of digital nomads and <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uDdDyheNY_-Z3MtuNoFdBYBooBnUTmlYCOZ3VhcN9Sw/edit#gid=0">remote startups</a>. <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>, <a href="https://buffer.com/">Buffer</a>, and <a href="http://wordpress.com">Automattic/wordpress</a> come to mind. All of which, have done a fabulous job with culture + building great products. </p>
<br>
<p>  The challenge(s) of remote startup teams have been <a href="https://nomadlist.com/stories/zapier-remote-startup">discussed</a> several times (communication, timezones, clients, banking, hiring).  My friends at a few VC firms note internal policies have recently changed... Gone are the days where teams require a central office to be even considered for an investment.</p> <br>


<h2>Experiment 2 / hypothesis</h2>

<p>  My Personal Development  </p>
<br><br>
<p>  To be more human. More raw and open. Take a deeper look at purpose. </p>
<br>
<p>  For over a year now, I've been part of a small group called The Elephants (inspired by <a href="https://medium.com/things-ive-written/the-elephants-182870501589">Nick Crocker</a>). It's helped me immensely and I'd encourage you to check it out!</p>

<p>  Last year wasn't the hottest year (end of long term relationship + business struggles). Last October, I had a 4 week stint in Palm Springs and LA, but that trip was really about mental survival. I couldn't see the forest from the trees. </p>

<p>  Today, it's about building the future!!! Not survival. As my friend <a href="http://twitter.com/jorgepedret">Jorge</a> says, _THIS_ is my biggest Spirit Quest yet. A chance to shake it up, reset, explore, meet new humans, to work on me, build the scaffolding, a new foundation to move forward within. </p>

<p>  Traveling makes your mind more agile. It forces you to question everything. </p>

<p>  My plane touches down in 50 minutes. I have 2 nights of accommodation planned in old town, Split. I'm unsure where I'm off to next... And I couldn't be more excited! </p>

<p>  Have a suggestion or where I should travel to? Let me know in the comments. </p>
