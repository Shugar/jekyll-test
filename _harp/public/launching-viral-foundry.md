The last 6 months working as EiR at <a href="http://fullstack.ca">Full Stack</a> has been ridiculously awesome (more details + wrap up post to come). But today, I'm excited to to announce i'm starting my 'next thing'' called <a href="http://viralfoundry.com">Viral Foundry</a>. Thanks to Boris Mann, we're going to setup shop and keep playing out of the Full Stack office.

Viral Foundry is a product studio where I plan to build and test new video based products. We're also going to offer design/development/marketing services. Feel free to get in touch if you have something you want us to tackle. 

More details on our first product to follow shortly.
