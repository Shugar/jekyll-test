Just a few months shy of the two year anniversary, i’ve decided to share my photographs and videos of the riots from my apartment. The actual event(s) that led up to the riot the are well documented. All photographs and videos were captured on my Canon S90 and iPhone 4. Most footage was recorded from my apartment located on the corner of Robson and Seymour Street. I had 15 friends over for the game and we literally had a skybox view of the looters, cars on fire, and riot squad. By the time things had really escalated we couldn’t step out onto the balcony as there was too much tear gas.
